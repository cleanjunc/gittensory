// Shared footer for public Gittensory PR comments — and the viral-growth loop that drives outside

// PRIVACY: public comments must never use reward/payout/score/ranking wording (those throw in
// `sanitizePublicComment` via FORBIDDEN_PUBLIC_COMMENT_WORDS, and the product keeps private
// scoreability out of public output). This footer uses ONLY "earn" — a factual, public invitation,
// not a payout guarantee or a private-score disclosure.
